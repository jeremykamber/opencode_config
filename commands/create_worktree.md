description: Create worktree and launch implementation session for a plan
---

2. set up worktree for implementation:
   2a. read `hack/create_worktree.sh` and create a new worktree with the item id: `./hack/create_worktree.sh [item-id] BRANCH_NAME`

3. determine required data:

branch name
path to plan file (use relative path only)
launch prompt
command to run

**IMPORTANT PATH USAGE:**

- The thoughts/ directory is synced between the main repo and worktrees
- Always use ONLY the relative path starting with `thoughts/shared/...` without any directory prefix
- Example: `thoughts/shared/plans/fix-mcp-keepalive-proper.md` (not the full absolute path)
- This works because thoughts are synced and accessible from the worktree

3a. confirm with the user by sending a message to the Human

```
based on the input, I plan to create a worktree with the following details:

worktree path: ~/wt/[item-id]
branch name: BRANCH_NAME
path to plan file: $FILEPATH
launch prompt:

    /implement_plan at $FILEPATH and when you are done implementing and all tests pass, read ./claude/commands/commit.md and create a commit, then read ./claude/commands/describe_pr.md and create a PR, then update the item in backlog.md with the PR link

command to run:

    /implement_plan at $FILEPATH and when you are done implementing and all tests pass, read ./claude/commands/commit.md and create a commit, then read ./claude/commands/describe_pr.md and create a PR, then update the item in backlog.md with the PR link
```

incorporate any user feedback then:

4. implement: `/implement_plan at $FILEPATH and when you are done implementing and all tests pass, read ./claude/commands/commit.md and create a commit, then read ./claude/commands/describe_pr.md and create a PR, then update the item in backlog.md with the PR link`
